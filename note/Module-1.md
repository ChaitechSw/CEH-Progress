## Module 1 : Introduction to ethical hacking

### Elements of Information Security
1. **Confidentiality**
	- Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
	- Protected health information (PHI)
	- Sensitivity

2. **Integrity**
	- Data Integrity
	- Information Sensitivity
	- System Integrity
	- Baseline to compare integrity of data or systems state

3. **Availability**
	- Data or information and systems are available to authorized users when as when required.
	- Criticality

4. **Authenticity**
	- Validating user identity
	- Something you know: Passwords or passphrases
	- Something you have: Tokens, memory cards, smart cards
	- Something you are: Biometrics, measurable characteristics
	- Single factor authentication, Multi-factor authentication

5. **Non-Repudiation**
	- Protection against false denying

6. **Privacy**
	- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, EU)
	- Health Insurance, Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA, USA)

### Information Security Attacks: Motives, Goals, and Objectives
