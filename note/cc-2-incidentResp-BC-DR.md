## Module-2. Incident Response, Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Concepts
### Incident Terminology
1. Breach
	- occurrence where unauthorized/authorized person accesses PII without an authorization for the same.
	- NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5
2. Event
	- Any observable occurrence in a network or system.
	- NIST SP 800-61 Rev 2
3. Exploit
	- A particular attack.
	- It is named this way because these attacks exploit system vulnerabilities.
4. Incident
	- An event that actually or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system or the information the system processes, stores, or transmits.
5. Intrusion
	- A security event, or combination of events, that constitutes a deliberate security incident in which an intruder gains, or attempts to gain, access to a system or system resource without authorization.
	- IETF RFC 4949 Ver 2
6. Threat
	- Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of service. 
	- NIST SP 800-30 Rev 1
7. Vulnerability
	- Weakness in any organizational entity that could be exploited by a threat source.
	- NIST SP 800-30 Rev 1
8. Zero Day
	- Unknown vulnerability which could not be detected or prevented by patterns, signatures or methods.

### The Goal of Incidence Response
1. Priority of IR is to protect life, health and safety. Safety comes first.
2. Primary goal is preparation (crisis management) which requires having a policy and response plan.
3. Incidence response plan comes under Business Continuity Management (BCM)

### Incident Response plan
1. Preparation
	- Developing a policy approved by management.
	- Identifying critical data and systems and any single points of failure.
	- Incident response training to staff
	- Incident response team implementation 
	- First response i.e., incidence identification practice.
	- Roles and responsibilities identification
	- Coordination of communication between stakeholders planning
	- Considering the possibility that a primary method of communication may not be available.
2. Detection and analysis
	- Monitoring all possible attack vectors
	- Analyzing the incident using known data and threat intelligence
	- Incident response prioritization
	- Standardization of incident documentation
3. Containment
	- Evidence gathering 
	- Choosing an appropriate containment strategy
	- Identification of the attacker
	- Isolation of attack
4. Post-Incident Activity
	- Identifcation of evidence that may need retention
	- Documentation of lessons learned
	- Conduct a retrospective of all four stages i.e., preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery, post-incident activity.

### Incident Response Team
1. First Responders (IT professionals) are like medical first responders (eg., nurses)
2. IR team is comprised of :
	- Representatives of senior management
	- Info security professionals
	- Legal representatives
	- Public communications/affairs representatives
	- Engineering representatives (system and network)
3. Many organizations have dedicated IR teams comprised of computer incident response teams (CIRTs) or computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs).
4. IR team responsibilites when incident occurs are as follows:
	- Determining the amount and scope of damage caused by the incident.
	- Determining whether any confidential information was compromised during the incident. 
	- Implemention of any necessary recovery procedures to restore security and recover from incident-related damage.
	- Supervising the implementation of any additional security measures necessary to improve security and prevent recurrence of the incident.

### Business Continuity	
1. Intent
	- To sustain business operations while recovering from a remarkable/consequential disruption.
2. Importance
	- To maintain the business
3. Key part
	- Communication, multiple contact methodologies, backup numbers.
4. Components
	- List of the BCP team members, including multiple contact methods and backup members
	- Immediate response procedures and checklists (security and safety procedures, fire suppression procedures, notification of appropriate emergency-response agencies, etc.)
	- Notification systems and call trees for alerting personnel that the BCP is being enacted
	- Guidance for management, including designation of authority for specific managers
	- How/when to enact the plan
	- Contact numbers for critical members of the supply chain (vendors, customers, possible external emergency providers, third-party partners)

### Disaster Recovery
1. Intent
	- restoring the IT and communication service/systems for organization during disruption and restoration of normal services.
	- disaster recovery plan (DRP)
2. Components
	- Executive summary providing a high-level overview of the plan
	- Department-specific plans
	- Technical guides for IT personnel responsible for implementing and maintaining critical backup systems
	- Full copies of the plan for critical disaster recovery team members

### Business continuity planning is about maintaining critical business functions, disaster recovery planning is about restoring IT and communications back to full operations after a disruption.
